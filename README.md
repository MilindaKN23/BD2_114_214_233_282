## YAH (Yet Another Hadoop)

* YAH is a mini-HDFS setup on your system, complete with the architectural structure consisting of Data Nodes and Name Nodes and replication of data across nodes. 
* With YAH, one can possess finer control over your data blocks and their replication, and allow you to create a distributed file system as per your needs. 
* YAH also allows running Hadoop like jobs to break down computationally heavy tasks into smaller distributed tasks.
